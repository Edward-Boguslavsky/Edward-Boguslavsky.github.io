					Computer Club Head - Programming & Leadership
					<span class="subtitle">
						07/09/2017, Club
					</span>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Becoming the head of the Computer Science club at my high school was my own decision. Ever since I began attending the weekly meetups in my second year, I’ve always wanted to give back to the club by taking the place of my club instructors. In my final year of high school, once I became the head, it was my responsibility to organize lessons, teach them to the club goers and provide extra help to any students who feel they are falling behind in the material. I did just that; I researched interesting programming topics and made them into PowerPoint presentations which I went over during the weekly club meetings. As a result, I received praise from the Computer Science department and my efforts have been commemorated by the photograph (as shown above) that was taken by the school to insert into the yearbook. The programming knowledge I gained will be useful towards any job in that industry, while the leadership skills will beneficial for any management position where I might need to train or instruct a group of employees.

					Reddit Redesign - Web Development & Teamwork
					<span class="subtitle">
						12/01/2019, Hobby
					</span>
				</h3>
				<p>
					The idea of working on my web development skills by redesigning existing websites (such as Reddit) has been with me for a long time, however, after another Reddit user with a similar idea wanted to start a new redesign project, I gladly joined their team. As a two-man team, we wrote a custom stylesheet for a basic Reddit page in order to modify it so that it incorporates some modern design elements. By communicating with my partner through social media, we added our own snippets of code to the stylesheet one-by-one until we agreed upon a final product. The project is close to but not yet complete (as shown above), but when both of us are satisfied with our work, we will submit our work to a Reddit community which will rate it and implement it into their own work. This project helped expand my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the environments they run in. If I pursue a web development career or hobby, this knowledge will be essential in helping me transform databases into something more web/user friendly. Furthermore, this unusual approach to teamwork helped me understand how to collaborate with others online, when meeting them in person isn’t an option.

					Personal Profile
				</h3>
				<p>
					I am an optimistic and social first-year student majoring in Computer Science and New Media at the University of Toronto. As a great team leader and problem solver, I hope to enter the software engineering industry and tackle large projects to further the software and artificial intelligence industry, while also pursuing my hobby of web design. 
				</p>
				<p>
					My short-term goal is to secure a developer position at either a small start-up or a large tech corporation for my first work term. My long-term goal is work a project managment, programming-related position at a large tech corporation. With real-world experience in my field and an environment that requires me to frequently communicate with coworkers, being promoted to a managment position down the road will become a viable option for developing my career.
